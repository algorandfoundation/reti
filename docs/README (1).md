# Réti Pooling Overview

## Protocol Overview

The Réti Pooling protocol facilitates the creation of decentralized staking pools on the Algorand network, enabling groups of individuals to participate in consensus together. Users are able to trustlessly stake to a Validator and earn yield based on the rewards the Validator receives.

* The protocol allows anyone to create or join staking pools.
* The protocol is completely decentralized and non-custodial.
* Validators can configure pools to suit varied needs while maintaining core immutable parameters.
